# Q. Diane finds out Ken's married

## Int. Diane's apartment - Kitchen - morning

Diane is humming to herself while cooking. She carefully places the items into two bento boxes, with chopsticks. She wraps them up, and puts a post card with Ken's name on one of them. The song that she's humming starts to play as background music. It is a happy and hopeful song.

She takes the lunches and her bag and exits her apartment. 

## Ext. Suburban Queens streets - cloudy morning
Diane puts her bags into the basket of her bike and starts to bike towards the suburban New York street. Despite it being a cloudy day, she is radiant. We follow her short commute to work.

## Int. Co-working space - pantry
Diane skips inside, the music fades as we start to hear the chatter in the office. Right when she is about to enter the pantry.

CO-WORKER 1
You are so lucky your wife packs lunch for you. Every day is a challenge for me to choose what to order.

KEN
Often they are just left overs from last night. And my wife is a diaster in the kitchen, so I made most of the food.

DIANE leans against the wall listening in. Suddenly the suspicions from the last few weeks start flooding in. 

- [ ] Snippets of their convos play in her head. (replay audio or speech bubbles crowd her)

DIANE drops the bento boxes on the floor and dashes away.

## Ext. Office park - morning - rain
Thunder sounds as DIANE walks out of the office. Diane starts running as the sky opens up and starts to rain. Contrast this with her bike ride for work.

She walks through the commercial area her office is in, show the various businesses she passes. Work messages with the timestamp starts popping up, but she just keeps on walking.

We enter a residential neighborhood where an elderly woman comes out and curses as she brings the clothes on the hanging lines back in.

DIANE (VO)
Even if I cry, will it matter? My tears will be taken away by the rain, just like the rain by the Long Island sound.

DIANE walks all the way to Bay Terrance park, and stares at the lighthouse.

## Int. Diane's bedroom - night
DIANE is dried up, she in wearing only underwear and Ken's sweatshirt. It is dark except the lights from her two Pokemon lamps. She is rolled up fetal position and starts to cry. She continues throughout the night. Crying and shivering.
