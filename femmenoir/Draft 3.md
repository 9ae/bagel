==Think of each character introduction==


# Q. Diane finds out Ken's married

## Int. Diane's apartment - Kitchen - morning

Diane is humming to herself while cooking. She carefully places the items into two bento boxes, with chopsticks. She wraps them up, and puts a post card with Ken's name on one of them. The song that she's humming starts to play as background music. It is a happy and hopeful song.

She takes the lunches and her bag and exits her apartment. 

## Ext. Suburban Queens streets - cloudy morning
Diane puts her bags into the basket of her bike and starts to bike towards the suburban New York street. Despite it being a cloudy day, she is radiant. We follow her short commute to work.

## Int. Co-working space - pantry
Diane skips inside, the music fades as we start to hear the chatter in the office. Right when she is about to enter the pantry.

CO-WORKER 1
You are so lucky your wife packs lunch for you. Every day is a challenge for me to choose what to order.

KEN
Often they are just left overs from last night. And my wife is a diaster in the kitchen, so I made most of the food.

DIANE leans against the wall listening in. Suddenly the suspicions from the last few weeks start flooding in. 

- [ ] Snippets of their convos play in her head. (replay audio or speech bubbles crowd her)

DIANE drops the bento boxes on the floor and dashes away.

## Ext. Office park - morning - rain
Thunder sounds as DIANE walks out of the office. Diane starts running as the sky opens up and starts to rain. Contrast this with her bike ride for work.

She walks through the commercial area her office is in, show the various businesses she passes. Work messages with the timestamp starts popping up, but she just keeps on walking.

We enter a residential neighborhood where an elderly woman comes out and curses as she brings the clothes on the hanging lines back in.

DIANE walks all the way to Bay Terrance park, and stares at the lighthouse.

DIANE (VO)
Even if I cry, will it matter? My tears will be taken away by the rain, just like the rain by the river.
## Int. Diane's bedroom - night
DIANE is dried up, she in wearing only underwear and Ken's sweatshirt. It is dark, except the lights from her two Pokemon lamps. She is rolled up fetal position and starts to cry. She continues throughout the night. Crying and shivering.

# E. Diane follow Elanor

## Ext. Elementary school - afternoon

Elanor is greeting parents who come to pick up their kids from school. We reveal that Diane is watching her from a bus stop, pretending to wait for a bus. She is reading a printed out stack of paper which turns out to be Brienne and Cersei fanfiction.

DIANE (VO)
Who is the woman you've kept a secret from me. Am I also a secret you've kept from her?

The last of her student leaves, and she head towards the bus stop. Diane shocked and is worried Elanor caught her.

DIANE (THINKS)
Maybe she does know about me.

ELANOR stands on line next to DIANE on the bus stop. She catches a glimpse of the chapter title of what Diane is reading.

ELANOR
Wait! Is that "May winter come" you are reading?

DIANE blushes as she looks up.
Um.. are you a Queen and Lady Knight shipper too?

ELANOR nods excitedly.
They are such an obscure pair, since they only had one scene together in canon. I've never met another fan in real life.

DIANE
We are such a small community, and everyone is really nice. Since are strictly fannon, we never get into any shipping wars.

ELANOR
Have you read __ ?

DIANE
No, I'm a little behind. But I heard it's mostly smut. I'm much more into the slow burns. They both have so much character development they need to go through before they make sense together.

ELANOR
Haha, I can see yo are the yearning type of romantic.

DIANE
Maybe I'm too much of a romantic. I can't seem to see past the obvious lies.

ELANOR looking into the distance
Sometimes we let ourselves believe in the lies, because confronting the truth will upend everything.

The bus finally arrive, it looks as if several bus loads of people are all crammed in. Diane and Elanor makes their way in, they find a stop in the back next to each other.
## Int. bus - afternoon

- [ ] they continue talking

The bus takes a sharp turn and everyone swoosh to one side. Elanor gets pressed up against Diane.  Diane tries to hold herself and Elanor still.

DIANE (THINKS)
If this were a rom-com it would be our meet cute. She'll say sorry, and we'll start talking.
*Diane blushes at the thought.*
If only we met under different circumstances.

ELANOR (THINKS)
That smell. So distinct, yet so familiar.

Everyone on the bus is back i upright position. Elanor is still frozen and lost in thought.

DIANE shakes Elanor
You ok?

ELANOR snaps out of it. She looks at Diane and scans her.

ELANOR
I'm the next stop.

The bus makes a stop and Elanor abruptly dashes for the door.

## Ext. street - small commercial district - afternoon

Turns out Elanor is very far away from home, but she walks the rest of the way.
