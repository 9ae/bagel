==Think of each character introductions==

# A. Elanor & Diane in the woods

ELANOR is sitting on a cello case, DIANE is digging.

- [ ] They talk, Diane ask why doesn't she help out

ELANOR jumps into the ditch. Camera pulls back to tilt into an aerial view, it zooms out to reveal the trees as shadows and fades to black.

# B. Elanor & ken in the morning

## Int. Elanor & Ken's walk-in closet - morning

Coming black ELANOR turns on the light in a closet. She is surrounded by stuff.

ELANOR: Ken! Have you seen my box of glue sticks?

ELANOR is looking through a box of journaling & scrap booking supplies. She pulls out parts from a model train set. She makes a disgruntled noise and and puts the box back on the shelf. She continues to look through shelves. We can see they are label, but things on it are misplaced. She reach’s for a high shelf where Ken’s model train supplies to resort. Her watch beep indicating it’s time to head out. She gives up and is about to head out of the closet. A contrabass case falls and blocks the door of the walk-in closet.

ELANOR *yells out the door*
Can you please, come up and help me?

A few seconds pass, no one is coming up. She lets out an aggravated groan and shoves it aside. She loudly makes it down the stairs of a town house.

KEN 31, 5’6, with short parted hair is looking down at his phone while leaning on the kitchen counter. Something on his phone makes him laugh, and he let’s out a chuckle. His mind is clearly somewhere else.

ELANOR *walks up to KEN’s face.*
Hey!

KEN *looks up*
Are you ready? Let’s go, I have an investor meeting today.

ELANOR
I called you several times, didn’t you hear?

KEN
Well our walls are pretty good at sound isolation, hun.

ELANOR
If you can hear my students playing from upstairs while you are in the basement. You certainly can here me call for you.

KEN *sighs and puts his phone in his pocket*

ELANOR
Have you seen my glue sticks?

KEN
No, aren’t they with your scrapbook supplies.

ELANOR
Stationary supplies

KEN
Whatever, why do you need them now anyway.

ELANOR
Because the school cut funding for art supplies, so teachers have to bring their own for any activities.

KEN
Oh, maybe we can just pick up some on the way at Target?

ELANOR
That’s not the point I got a whole bunch while they were on sale. I don’t need another pack to keep around. We already have too much stuff. *You* have too many hobbies.

KEN
Can you blame me? I’m just compelled to create.

ELANOR
What about your contrabass? You haven’t touched it in years. I can give it to one of my students. Terry’s playing annoys his parents, maybe I can give him something less painful to practice with.

KEN
But that’s for keepsake, that’s how we meet. Remember, you first violinist and I the walking case.

ELANOR *looks as if she’s about to say something but just shakes it off*
Let’s go I’m late.

They turn off the lights and head out the house. 

## Ext. Street with row of narrow town houses - morning

KEN presses the key and a car diagonally across the street unlocks. He crosses the street, the suddenly a black sports car come racing down the street, then turns to face the car just as it’s about to hit him. Lens flare burst to white screen.

ELANOR shakes herself as she opens her eyes, KEN safely made it across the street. There was never a black car that passed by. He hops in his car, as she gathers herself she makes her way to the car.

ELANOR (VO)
Sometimes I dream

## Int. Car

 We pass an almost residential area, with a few small businesses in on the ground floors. One house advertised it’s marriage counseling services, and it’s basement tenant is an adult toy store.

ELANOR
Maybe we

KEN
We’ve tried it before, it didn’t work.

ELANOR
Because you missed every other session.

KEN
It’s hard to have appointments when your team is launching a new product.
Maybe we try someone other than Father Daniel? It’s weird, he feels too much like family. We’ve known him since you were in Youth group.

ELANOR
This time it will be different?

KEN doesn’t answer. They spend the rest of the car ride in silence, until KEN slows down and pulls up to the playground of an elementary school.

# N. Elanor smells Ken's shirt

## Int. bedroom - night

ELANOR walks into the bedroom and see a pile of clothes on the floor. She sighs as she picks them up. She picks up the shirt Diane gave him.

ELANOR *holds the shirt up to her nose.*
Fruity and crisp.

She stares into space and a bunch of images flashes across her mind.
- She walks up to her car to see Ken kissing someone
- Their living room with scattered plates, and floor lamp fallen
- Ken walking out
- Ken on his knees pleading her to stay
- Elanor gripping a knife tightly.

KEN *comes into the room*
Babe, have you seen my ---

ELANOR *spins around*
What's this?!

KEN notices the expression on her face.
It's not what you think?

ELANOR
Oh yea? Did you just decide to buy a new shirt? You who's been walking around with holes in all his socks for years? Every Christmas, I'm just stuffing socks in your sock.

KEN
Coffee spilled, and someone at the work space lent me a shirt.

ELANOR
How convient?

KEN *grabs the shirt from Elanor.*
You're paranoid

ELANOR
Oh you think?

KEN
Nothing happened with her! And it years ago!

ELANOR
And yet you took a chance.

KEN
You'll never forgive me, will you?

ELANOR looks stern standing there. She doesn't say anything putting the rest of the laundry in the hamper and walks out of the room.

# Q. Diane finds out Ken's married

## Int. Diane's apartment - Kitchen - morning

Diane is humming to herself while cooking. She carefully places the items into two bento boxes, with chopsticks. She wraps them up, and puts a post card with Ken's name on one of them. The song that she's humming starts to play as background music. It is a happy and hopeful song.

She takes the lunches and her bag and exits her apartment. 

## Ext. Suburban Queens streets - cloudy morning
Diane puts her bags into the basket of her bike and starts to bike towards the suburban New York street. Despite it being a cloudy day, she is radiant. We follow her short commute to work.

## Int. Co-working space - pantry
Diane skips inside, the music fades as we start to hear the chatter in the office. Right when she is about to enter the pantry.

CO-WORKER 1
You are so lucky your wife packs lunch for you. Every day is a challenge for me to choose what to order.

KEN
Often they are just left overs from last night. And my wife is a diaster in the kitchen, so I made most of the food.

DIANE leans against the wall listening in. Suddenly the suspicions from the last few weeks start flooding in. 

- [ ] Snippets of their convos play in her head. (replay audio or speech bubbles crowd her)

DIANE drops the bento boxes on the floor and dashes away.

## Ext. Office park - morning - rain
Thunder sounds as DIANE walks out of the office. Diane starts running as the sky opens up and starts to rain. Contrast this with her bike ride for work.

She walks through the commercial area her office is in, show the various businesses she passes. Work messages with the timestamp starts popping up, but she just keeps on walking.

We enter a residential neighborhood where an elderly woman comes out and curses as she brings the clothes on the hanging lines back in.

DIANE walks all the way to Bay Terrance park, and stares at the lighthouse.

DIANE (VO)
Even if I cry, will it matter? My tears will be taken away by the rain, just like the rain by the river.
## Int. Diane's bedroom - night
DIANE is dried up, she in wearing only underwear and Ken's sweatshirt. It is dark, except the lights from her two Pokemon lamps. She is rolled up fetal position and starts to cry. She continues throughout the night. Crying and shivering.

# E. Diane follow Elanor

## Ext. Elementary school - afternoon

Elanor is greeting parents who come to pick up their kids from school. We reveal that Diane is watching her from a bus stop, pretending to wait for a bus. She is reading a printed out stack of paper which turns out to be Brienne and Cersei fanfiction.

DIANE (VO)
Who is the woman you've kept a secret from me. Am I also a secret you've kept from her?

The last of her student leaves, and she head towards the bus stop. Diane shocked and is worried Elanor caught her.

DIANE (THINKS)
Maybe she does know about me.

ELANOR stands on line next to DIANE on the bus stop. She catches a glimpse of the chapter title of what Diane is reading.

ELANOR
Wait! Is that "May winter come" you are reading?

DIANE blushes as she looks up.
Um.. are you a Queen and Lady Knight shipper too?

ELANOR nods excitedly.
Oh my….! I've never met another fan in real life.

DIANE
Me neither. We are such a small bunch.

ELANOR
Have you read __ ?

DIANE
No, I'm a little behind. But I heard it's mostly smut. I'm much more into the slow burns. They both have so much character development they need to go through before they make sense together.

ELANOR
Haha, I can see yo are the yearning romantic type. 

DIANE
Maybe I'm too much of a romantic. I can't seem to see past the obvious lies.

ELANOR looking into the distance
Sometimes we let ourselves believe in the lies, because confronting the truth will upend everything.

The bus finally arrive, it looks as if several bus loads of people are all crammed in. Diane and Elanor makes their way in, they find a stop in the back next to each other.
## Int. bus - afternoon

- [ ] they continue talking

The bus takes a sharp turn and everyone swoosh to one side. Elanor gets pressed up against Diane.  Diane tries to hold herself and Elanor still.

DIANE (THINKS)
If this were a rom-com it would be our meet cute. She'll say sorry, and we'll start talking.
*Diane blushes at the thought.*
If only we met under different circumstances.

ELANOR (THINKS)
That smell. So distinct, yet so familiar.

Everyone on the bus is back i upright position. Elanor is still frozen and lost in thought.

DIANE shakes Elanor
You ok?

ELANOR snaps out of it. She looks at Diane and scans her.

ELANOR
I'm the next stop.

The bus makes a stop and Elanor abruptly dashes for the door.

## Ext. street - small commercial district - afternoon

Turns out Elanor is very far away from home, but she walks the rest of the way.

# F. Elanor walks home

## Ext. street - small commercial district - afternoon

ELANOR (VO 1)
Wow, you really are making excuses for yourself aren't you?

ELANOR (VO 2)
Maybe I'm just paranoid

ELANOR (VO 1)
You have a right to be, it happened once, can happen again.

ELANOR (VO 2)
Will it ever be not something that's constantly burning over my mind?

ELANOR (VO 1)
Maybe when he's dead

ELANOR
Shut up!

The streets are quiet a few pedestrians look at her, but most just continue on their way.

## Int. bedroom - evening

Ken is in the shower, you can here the water running. ELANOR walks up to the night stand and picks up his phone. She enters in his passcode, and checks his messages. Nothing out of the ordinary. Photos, just phones of them and their family, and his hobbies.

ELANOR (VO)
This is pathetic, I'm just paranoid.

A Lyft notification saids "thank you for being a frequent user, and rewards him with $10 off his next ride."

ELANOR (VO)
Wait, but we have a car.

She opens the Lyft app, and looks through the ride history. They are travel to and back from one address. The shower sounds stops. She takes a screenshot and sends it to her own phone. And dashes out the room, down the stairs, and out.

KEN comes out from the bathroom into the bedroom in a towel, and sees his phone on the floor.

KEN
Elanor? Elanor!

He looks all over the house, and finally see the car keys are missing. He picks up his phone to call Diane.


# I. Elanor visits Diane

## Int. Diane's apartment - night

DIANE in a silk bathrobe, a glass of red wine. She looks outside as her phone rings, she makes no motion to answer it.

DIANE (VO)
That night Ken called me four times. I let them go to voicemail. I knew what was coming. Whether he ends it, or I end it when we talk again. Should have known it was all too good to be true. What we had will all just fade into a beautiful memory.

The doorbell rings, DIANE almost spills her wine.

DIANE
Guess there's no avoiding now.

She walks down the steps to open the door, expecting to see Ken.

DIANE
We need to talk, right?

ELANOR
We most certainly do.

DIANE looks up to realize it's not Ken. The two women stand there looking at each other for a long moment. DIANE opens her door wider and steps back, giving space for ELANOR  to enter. She steps in closing the door. As they walk up the stairs.

ELANOR
Nice place, do you life here alone?

DIANE
Yea, when my company moved offices from the city to all the way in deep Queens. It didn't make sense to be paying all that money no green space at all.

When they reach the living area, ELANOR scans the room.

ELANOR
So, this is where he goes when I'm at tutoring or at church.

DIANE
I didn't know...

ELANOR
Know what? That it was my husband you have over?

DIANE takes a step backward.

ELANOR
You knew enough to find me.

DIANE *takes in a breathe.*
I just found out a few days ago.

ELANOR *sighs*
This again?

DIANE
What do you mean?

ELANOR
Don't think you were the first. And you certainly won't be the last.

DIANE *looks away, holding back tears.*
I really thought what he and I had was special.

ELANOR
Didn't we all? What sweetness did he whisper? Promises he made? Promises knew he could never keep?

DIANE
If you knew about this all along, why do you....?

ELANOR
Stay in this marriage? We've been together since high school, my family have adopted him as their own, he goes to our church. They all love him. A divorce would....My family can't afford another scandal.

DIANE
You mean another time when Ken had....

ELANOR *shakes her head*
No. It's not that, he's smart enough to not dip his toes into that pool.
In middle school, I got pretty close with the pastor's daughter.

DIANE 
Oh, you're a moth, huh?

ELANOR
We didn't know what to call it, but we were a little more than best friends.

DIANE
Believed they called it "gal pals" back in the day.

ELANOR
One afternoon, her mom walked up to give us snacks.
*twirls Diane's wine glass*
Then suddenly my family was going to another church.

DIANE
I guess... guess... your family is rather religious?

ELANOR
Not really. It wasn't that.

DIANE
Maybe they didn't want to admit it to themselves...

ELANOR
They never asked if I am... if I like... Mom just said "that girl is a bad influence. Next Sunday we're checking out St. Robert Bellarmine".
*She chuckles*
We weren't even Catholic. But church is the only community we had since coming to the States. Our old pastor helped my dad find his first job. I can't afford for my family to at the center of gossip again. Not after, we've finally found or place in this country.

DIANE
So you...?

ELANOR
Rather, not know to be honest. But you came to find me, and...

DIANE
I'm going to end things with him.

ELANOR
It doesn't matter if you do, I'm still trapped in his marriage.
Sometimes I wish some horrible accident will fall upon him.
Better a widow than divorcee.
