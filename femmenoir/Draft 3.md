# A. Elanor & Diane in the woods

ELANOR is sitting on a cello case, DIANE is digging.

- [ ] They talk, Diane ask why doesn't she help out

ELANOR jumps into the ditch. Camera pulls back to tilt into an aerial view, it zooms out to reveal the trees as shadows and fades to black.

# B. Elanor & ken in the morning

## Int. Elanor & Ken's walk-in closet - morning

Coming black ELANOR turns on the light in a closet. She is surrounded by stuff.

ELANOR: Ken! Have you seen my box of glue sticks?

ELANOR is looking through a box of journaling & scrap booking supplies. She pulls out parts from a model train set. She makes a disgruntled noise and and puts the box back on the shelf. She continues to look through shelves. We can see they are label, but things on it are misplaced. She reach’s for a high shelf where Ken’s model train supplies to resort. Her watch beep indicating it’s time to head out. She gives up and is about to head out of the closet. A contrabass case falls and blocks the door of the walk-in closet.

ELANOR *yells out the door*
Can you please, come up and help me?

A few seconds pass, no one is coming up. She lets out an aggravated groan and shoves it aside. She loudly makes it down the stairs of a town house.

KEN 31, 5’6, with short parted hair is looking down at his phone while leaning on the kitchen counter. Something on his phone makes him laugh, and he let’s out a chuckle. His mind is clearly somewhere else.

ELANOR *walks up to KEN’s face.*
Hey!

KEN *looks up*
Are you ready? Let’s go, I have an investor meeting today.

ELANOR
I called you several times, didn’t you hear?

KEN
Well our walls are pretty good at sound isolation, hun.

ELANOR
If you can hear my students playing from upstairs while you are in the basement. You certainly can here me call for you.

KEN *sighs and puts his phone in his pocket*

ELANOR
Have you seen my glue sticks?

KEN
No, aren’t they with your scrapbook supplies.

ELANOR
Stationary supplies

KEN
Whatever, why do you need them now anyway.

ELANOR
Because the school cut funding for art supplies, so teachers have to bring their own for any activities.

KEN
Oh, maybe we can just pick up some on the way at Target?

ELANOR
That’s not the point I got a whole bunch while they were on sale. I don’t need another pack to keep around. We already have too much stuff. *You* have too many hobbies.

KEN
Can you blame me? I’m just compelled to create.

ELANOR
What about your contrabass? You haven’t touched it in years. I can give it to one of my students. Terry’s playing annoys his parents, maybe I can give him something less painful to practice with.

KEN
But that’s for keepsake, that’s how we meet. Remember, you first violinist and I the walking case.

ELANOR *looks as if she’s about to say something but just shakes it off*
Let’s go I’m late.

They turn off the lights and head out the house. 

## Ext. Street with row of narrow town houses - morning

KEN presses the key and a car diagonally across the street unlocks. He crosses the street, the suddenly a black sports car come racing down the street, then turns to face the car just as it’s about to hit him. Lens flare burst to white screen.

ELANOR shakes herself as she opens her eyes, KEN safely made it across the street. There was never a black car that passed by. He hops in his car, as she gathers herself she makes her way to the car.

ELANOR (VO)
Sometimes I dream

## Int. Car

 We pass an almost residential area, with a few small businesses in on the ground floors. One house advertised it’s marriage counseling services, and it’s basement tenant is an adult toy store.

ELANOR
Maybe we

KEN
We’ve tried it before, it didn’t work.

ELANOR
Because you missed every other session.

KEN
It’s hard to have appointments when your team is launching a new product.
Maybe we try someone other than Father Daniel? It’s weird, he feels too much like family. We’ve known him since you were in Youth group.

ELANOR
This time it will be different?

KEN doesn’t answer. They spend the rest of the car ride in silence, until KEN slows down and pulls up to the playground of an elementary school.

# Q. Diane finds out Ken's married

## Int. Diane's apartment - Kitchen - morning

Diane is humming to herself while cooking. She carefully places the items into two bento boxes, with chopsticks. She wraps them up, and puts a post card with Ken's name on one of them. The song that she's humming starts to play as background music. It is a happy and hopeful song.

She takes the lunches and her bag and exits her apartment. 

## Ext. Suburban Queens streets - cloudy morning
Diane puts her bags into the basket of her bike and starts to bike towards the suburban New York street. Despite it being a cloudy day, she is radiant. We follow her short commute to work.

## Int. Co-working space - pantry
Diane skips inside, the music fades as we start to hear the chatter in the office. Right when she is about to enter the pantry.

CO-WORKER 1
You are so lucky your wife packs lunch for you. Every day is a challenge for me to choose what to order.

KEN
Often they are just left overs from last night. And my wife is a diaster in the kitchen, so I made most of the food.

DIANE leans against the wall listening in. Suddenly the suspicions from the last few weeks start flooding in. 

- [ ] Snippets of their convos play in her head. (replay audio or speech bubbles crowd her)

DIANE drops the bento boxes on the floor and dashes away.

## Ext. Office park - morning - rain
Thunder sounds as DIANE walks out of the office. Diane starts running as the sky opens up and starts to rain. Contrast this with her bike ride for work.

She walks through the commercial area her office is in, show the various businesses she passes. Work messages with the timestamp starts popping up, but she just keeps on walking.

We enter a residential neighborhood where an elderly woman comes out and curses as she brings the clothes on the hanging lines back in.

DIANE walks all the way to Bay Terrance park, and stares at the lighthouse.

DIANE (VO)
Even if I cry, will it matter? My tears will be taken away by the rain, just like the rain by the river.
## Int. Diane's bedroom - night
DIANE is dried up, she in wearing only underwear and Ken's sweatshirt. It is dark, except the lights from her two Pokemon lamps. She is rolled up fetal position and starts to cry. She continues throughout the night. Crying and shivering.

# E. Diane follow Elanor

## Ext. Elementary school - afternoon

Elanor is greeting parents who come to pick up their kids from school. We reveal that Diane is watching her from a bus stop, pretending to wait for a bus. She is reading a printed out stack of paper which turns out to be Brienne and Cersei fanfiction.

DIANE (VO)
Who is the woman you've kept a secret from me. Am I also a secret you've kept from her?

The last of her student leaves, and she head towards the bus stop. Diane shocked and is worried Elanor caught her.

DIANE (THINKS)
Maybe she does know about me.

ELANOR stands on line next to DIANE on the bus stop. She catches a glimpse of the chapter title of what Diane is reading.

ELANOR
Wait! Is that "May winter come" you are reading?

DIANE blushes as she looks up.
Um.. are you a Queen and Lady Knight shipper too?

ELANOR nods excitedly.
Oh my….! I've never met another fan in real life.

DIANE
Me neither. We are such a small bunch.

ELANOR
Have you read __ ?

DIANE
No, I'm a little behind. But I heard it's mostly smut. I'm much more into the slow burns. They both have so much character development they need to go through before they make sense together.

ELANOR
Haha, I can see yo are the yearning romantic type. 

DIANE
Maybe I'm too much of a romantic. I can't seem to see past the obvious lies.

ELANOR looking into the distance
Sometimes we let ourselves believe in the lies, because confronting the truth will upend everything.

The bus finally arrive, it looks as if several bus loads of people are all crammed in. Diane and Elanor makes their way in, they find a stop in the back next to each other.
## Int. bus - afternoon

- [ ] they continue talking

The bus takes a sharp turn and everyone swoosh to one side. Elanor gets pressed up against Diane.  Diane tries to hold herself and Elanor still.

DIANE (THINKS)
If this were a rom-com it would be our meet cute. She'll say sorry, and we'll start talking.
*Diane blushes at the thought.*
If only we met under different circumstances.

ELANOR (THINKS)
That smell. So distinct, yet so familiar.

Everyone on the bus is back i upright position. Elanor is still frozen and lost in thought.

DIANE shakes Elanor
You ok?

ELANOR snaps out of it. She looks at Diane and scans her.

ELANOR
I'm the next stop.

The bus makes a stop and Elanor abruptly dashes for the door.

## Ext. street - small commercial district - afternoon

Turns out Elanor is very far away from home, but she walks the rest of the way.
