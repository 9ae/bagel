Please tell us about your personal connection to the material in your short film script. 
While the murder story is fictional, other elements are drawn from my personal experiences. I first became aware of my sapphic attraction by having a crush on the girl, my ex started dating after our break up. Parts of myself can be found in the character of Diane, who was an only child born to the CCP's “Having a girl is as good as having a boy” campaign. For several decades, Chinese parents will give their daughters androgynous names and encourage them to have high ambitions. I modeled Elanor after some of my high school friends, who faced a different kind of pressure from their families. While I don't think it's necessary to advertise it as such, Femme Noir is a queer Asian American story. It is under the specific cultural circumstances that our characters find themselves caught in the story's conflict. Yet, I don't think it is at that intersection that I feel the the urge to tell this story.
Stories often pit women against each other, especially if they are at opposing end of a love triangle. Love doesn't have to be a zero sum game, and the end of the day the only one this dynamic benefits is the person in the middle. Some of my best friends though live are exes of my partners, current partners of my exes, people my crush has a crush on, and metamours (partner of your partner in ethnically non-monogamous relationships). There is a magical bond in those dynamic that I want to share with my audience.

While the murder plot is fictional, much of the story draws from personal experiences. I first recognized my sapphic attraction when I developed a crush on the girl my ex started dating after we broke up. Diane reflects parts of me—an only child born during the CCP's "Having a girl is as good as having a boy" campaign, which encouraged parents to give daughters androgynous names and ambitious goals. Elanor, on the other hand, is inspired by my high school friends who faced similar familial pressures.

While the cultural dynamics shape the conflicts its characters find themselves in, making _Femme Noir_ is a queer Asian American story, it is not why I feel compelled to share this story.

Stories often pit women against each other, especially in love triangles. But this setup only benefits the person in the middle. Some of my closest friendships are with people tied to my romantic relationships—exes of my partners, current partners of my exes, people my crushes have crushes on, and metamours (partner of your partner in ethnically non-monogamous relationships). There’s something magical in these bonds, and that story I want to share with my audience. If only we can see people for who they are and not their roles in our relationship situation, there is a chance for us to have a profound connection.



What excites you about collaborating with Antigravity Academy and Dolby on your project, and what do you hope to gain creatively from the development process?

Just working towards this application process has taught me a lot about my artistic process. Such as project planning, realistic writing expectations, and color grading. The page limit provided a box for me to contain this story within. I work best under constraints, so having a budget and deadline will help me be strategic about how to tell this story. The mentorship with a producer will help me learn how to make wise decisions on a film project.
I am excited work together with talent, and look forward to learn from them. If the dance daydream sequence makes it into the production script, I will like to bring a choreographer to compose the dance sequence.

Preparing for this application has taught me a great deal about my artistic process. The page limit helped me contain the story, and I thrive under constraints, where budgets and deadlines push me to strategize effectively.
A mentorship with a producer will be invaluable in teaching me how to make smart decisions on a project. I’m eager to collaborate with talented individuals and learn from them. If the daydream sequence makes it into the final script, I’d love to work with a choreographer to bring it to life.

A majority of this story will be hold in a limited color palette and high contrast. Elanor’s dominant scenes are tinted blue, while Diane’s are red. As the story unfolds and they grow through each other, the scenes have a greater diversity of hues. By shooting the scenes in RAW, I will be able to color grade the scenes to show how the characters grow into each other. A good portion of this film takes place in the woods, I'm excited to be able to share the depth of nature with Dolby Vision.

Many scenes use music and sound to articulate the character's emotions and also foreshadow plot points. For example, when Elanor is about to meet Diane the whole scene turns silent. Her heart beat and the Diane's foot steps are the only thing you hear. I will like simulate the footsteps getting closer and closer to the audience with Dolby Atmos.

A synopsis, while more detailed than a logline, is still concise, summarizing the entire arc of your story, including its emotional journey and key plot points. A synopsis example might detail the protagonist's challenge, their pivotal decisions, and the climax, all while keeping the reader intrigued and wanting more.

What is the journey? For each character:

- Elanor: Constantly prioritizing others’ happiness and expectations, she struggles to recognize her own feelings. Diane challenges her to face the issues in her marriage, and helps her uncover her emotions and empowers her to fight for her own needs.  
- Diane: Having spent her early adulthood in academic and career pursuits, she does not have experience dating until she’s well into her 30s. She approaches romance with idealistic optimism. Despite repeated heartbreaks, she clings to a belief in magic and ignores the clear signs that Ken has been lying to her.  
- Ken: Constantly feels like he’s not enough, and thirsty for external validation. Like Elanor, he also struggles to articulate his feelings. While he feels trapped in his marriage, he’s afraid of letting it go because he believes maybe no one else will truly love him. Unable to articulate what he finds missing in the marriage to his partner, Ken finds emotional solace with Diane. 

Weave: Elanor and Ken’s problems. Diane.  
How the three of their problems collide in this moment in their lives.  
When the two women find out about each other, their sense of betrayal lead them to seek revenge. Little do they know what they need to heal is not retribution but each other.

What's the problem w/ their marriage?
Elanor and Ken married young, and now almost a decade into their marriage distance has built up between them from unvoiced grievances. Elanor has always tried to live up to the expectations of her family, therefore has poor awareness of her own wants and needs. Ken has been brought up to suppress his feelings, which he sees as a monster that lives inside him just waiting to wreck havoc. Unable to voice their unmet needs to each other, Ken finds solace with a woman in his co-working space. Diane, who feels jaded by attempting to date in her mid thirties, falls hard for Ken. When the two women find out about each other, their sense of betrayal lead them to seek revenge. Little do they know what they need to heal is not retribution but each other.

Elanor and Ken married young, but nearly a decade later, their relationship is fraying under the weight of unspoken grievances. Elanor, burdened by the expectations of her immigrant family, has lost sight of her own desires. Ken has been conditioned to bury his emotions by his upbringing. Yet he longs for emotional connection, and ends up finding solace in Diane, a coworker disillusioned by the struggles of dating in her mid-thirties. When Elanor and Diane discover each other’s roles in Ken’s life, they strike a vengeance alliance. As their paths entwine, they realize that what they truly need isn’t retribution—but each other.

- there's a lot I wanted to do with music and sound
- Started with my mis-interpretation of a song "No body, no crime". My understanding of it is the wife and other woman conspired together to kill a guy. Turns out, its not what that song is about but that plot bunny stayed in my head for years.
- And it's because in having the opposing parties in a love triangle unite instead of being in conflict with each other, represents my experiences. 
- And you don't often see that represented in media. In "Two Black Cadillacs" where they do conspire to kill the husband, but the two women never see each other again after the funeral.
- My story wants to take their dynamic further, beyond the betrayal and jealousy to recognize the humanity of the other person, because they probably have a lot more in common beyond loving the same person. What if they build a friendship, or maybe even fall in love.

The idea came from my misinterpretation of the song _"No Body, No Crime"_. I thought it was about a wife and the other woman conspiring to murder the husband. Even though that wasn’t Swift and HAIM's intent, the plot bunny stuck with me.

I’ve always been drawn to stories where opposing sides in a love triangle unite rather than fight, because it reflects my own experiences, but is rarely portrayed in media.

Even in the song _"Two Black Cadillacs"_, where the women do team up to kill the guy but they part ways after the funeral.

My story explores a scenario where they can see beyond betrayal and jealousy brought on by the circumstances, to recognize each other's humanity. Can they develop a friendship, or even fall in love?
