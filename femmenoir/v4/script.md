EXT. THE WOODS - 2AM
On a full moon night, the are lanterns on the floor. DIANE, mid 30s Chinese woman, wearing black windbreaker and athletic tights is digging furiously. ELANOR, late 20s Korean woman, is sitting on a contrabass case, in a cream dress with blood stains on the front skirt. Next to her is a sapling tree about 4 ft high in a pot.
DIANE looks up and makes eye contact with ELANOR, who nods back. ELANOR struggles to push the contrabass case. DIANE rolls her eyes and pounces out of the ditch to help. The two push it down and take a breathe. ELANOR looks a DIANE and wipes the sweat and dirt from her forehead with the frills of her sleeves.


DIANE
Your dress…
ELANOR
It’s a goner anyway.
ELANOR motions to the blood stains on it. DIANE points at her plant.
DIANE
Let’s finish up.
ELANOR
Why are we planting your houseplant on top? Is this your sentimental inklings? Like a grave only we know about?
DIANE
Umm… more so that even if the police come here sniffing, they can’t dig up this spot because the plant is endangered species.
ELANOR makes an “o” motion with her mouth.


HDW transition into the next scene?


INT. OUTSIDE DIANE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT


Goal: Who is E & D? What are their weaknesses?
How did who they are drive them to the conclusion of this scene?


Eleanor gets out of the car and strides purposefully towards a door. This neighborhood is composed of garden styled apartments. The buildings are no taller than two stories, each unit has own entrance. It’s quiet, except the sound of the street light in a low hum. She presses the doorbell hard. The ambient sound of the streets fade, replaced by Elanor’s heartbeats. She buzzes the bell again. We hear footsteps on a flight of stairs, the steps alternate with the heartbeats, creating a syncopated rhythm. The door opens revealing a Diane in Ken’s sweater vest and long silk lounge pants.


DIANE
Sorry, but I’m Buddhist.
ELANOR
I’m selling you the word of God. At least not tonight away.
DIANE
Oh ok. May I help you?
ELANOR
Yes, may you please explain why you are wearing my husband’s sweater?
DIANE bewildered at first, her eyes narrow as if trying to recount her recent memory.
KEN (memory)
What do you say instead of texting, pass handwritten notes?
DIANE (memory)
Haha, how romantic.
DIANE (memory)
Hmm… Can’t wait to be able to wake up by your side every day.
KEN (memory)
Uhh haha (nervous chuckle). Now aren’t we moving a bit too fast?
Upon realization of what this means, DIANE returns back to the present. Unable to look at Elanor’s face she looks diagonally down to mutter.


DIANE
Darn it! Those flags were always there.
DIANE takes a step back and gestures ELANOR to come in. The two start walking up the steps to Diane’s apartment. The camera follows their shadows walking up.


ELANOR
Nice place, do you live here alone?
DIANE freezes in her step and wonders if she’s made a mistake welcoming her in. She slowly nods and walks the rest of the flight up sideways with her eye on ELANOR. When they both reach the landing, ELANOR scans around.
ELANOR
So this is where he goes, while I’m teaching violin or leading bible study. 
DIANE
It wasn’t like that!
ELANOR
Oh yea? Care to tell me what it was like?! No, wait don’t. How did you guys even start?
DIANE
My company moved our offices into BaysideBuilds. I was new to the area.
INT. CO-WORKING SPACE PANTRY - MORNING
Enters DIANE, eyes puffy and almost in a daze, she's holding a thermomug. She is wearing a knee-length tight skirt, kitten heels, and a short blazer. She’s looking at her phone as she is walking, a message from a woman she was on a date with the previous night said, “It was fun last night, but I realized I’m not ready for a relationship yet.” Her next step lands on KEN's hands. He yelps out in pain, as DIANE loses balance and falls. The coffee spills on Ken's white shirt. Diane lands on top of him, and the two stare at each other momentarily.
KEN
Fuck! Watch where you're going.
DIANE
Oh my! So sorry. (pause) Hey, what were you doing on the floor.
KEN
Push ups. It helps with nerves; got an investor presentation later. I barely had enough time to prepare this morning. And now I've got to go home to change.
DIANE
I will lend you a shirt. The one I have might fit you.
KEN
Let's see it.
KEN follows DIANE to her office.
KEN
Wow, private office! Helix Medicine must be doing well.
He looks at her plate on the desk, “Director of Research”. DIANE searches through a wardrobe and pulls out a crisp white shirt. He takes it and checks the size. He pulls his current shirt over his head, surprising Diane, she blushes and turns away. KEN walks up to Diane and speaks closely to her ears.
KEN
Perfect, thanks.
DIANE jumps and turns to face him. She realizes how close their faces are to each other. She smiles awkwardly.


DIANE
You’ll ace it!
KEN
What makes you think that?
DIANE
You’re wearing my lucky shirt.
Fades to next flashback scene.
ELANOR (VO)
Oh so that explains the shirt.
INT. ELANOR & KEN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ELANOR walks into the bedroom and sees a pile of clothes on the floor. She sighs as she picks them up. She pauses at the shirt Diane gave him. She holds it up to her nose.
ELANOR
Citrus.
The camera adjust focus on her night stand, with a collection of floral perfumes. ELANOR narrows her eyes and grabs the shirt tighter. Lost in her own world, she doesn’t notice Ken enter the room.


KEN
Babe, have you seen my…
ELANOR
What's this?!
KEN
It's not what you think…
ELANOR
Oh yea? Did you just decide to buy a new shirt? You who's been walking around with holes in all his socks for years?
KEN
Coffee spilt, and someone at my workspace let me borrow a spare.
ELANOR
How convenient.
KEN grabs the shirt from ELANOR.


KEN
You're paranoid
ELANOR
Oh, you think?
KEN
That was years ago! You'll never forgive me, will you?
ELANOR looks stern standing there. She doesn't say anything putting the rest of the laundry in the hamper and walks out of the room.




INT. DIANE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Back to Eleanor and Diane, they are now both sitting down. Eleanor on a coach, Diane in her reading chair. Eleanor is holding a mug with a steaming beverage, Diane to a glass of red wine. Elanor looks down at the tea leaves, twirling her cup.


Elanor
Don't think you were the first. And you certainly won't be the last.
DIANE
Thought what we had was special.
ELANOR twirls the knife in her hand bag.


ELANOR
I thought with the other woman gone, things will go back to normal. But our normal is floating half alive. Ken and I have different ways of coping with being stuck together. His tends to involve some collateral.
DIANE
And you choose to live this way? You let him get away with it.
Scene needs to have hints to build up to this decision, that makes the turn believable.


ELANOR
Maybe not this time.
ELANOR gives a sly smile as she looks up at DIANE, and slides out the knife to reveal to DIANE. Instead of backing away, DIANE determinedly moves forward with her glass in a toast.


DIANE
Or ever again.




INT. CO-WORKING SPACE PANTRY - MORNING
DIANE sprinkles a few dashes of a blue powder into a pile of matcha, adding some water, she starts whisking. DIANE puts down a cup of matcha, with a small note continues to walk away towards her office. Ken opens the note and smiles. He looks like a man who's on the top of the world.


DIANE (VO)
I didn’t want to hurt her.
DIANE closes door to the office. She takes a deep breath, she’s shivering, and slides down crying.


DIANE (VO)
I convinced myself that helping her will make things even.




INT. ELANOR & KEN’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT


ELANOR
That was delicious! Thank you.
ELANOR puts down the napkin and starts clearing the plates.


KEN
Hun, are you okay? I’ve been pretty chipper tonight. Are your parents fighting again?
ELANOR
No, for once they haven’t called me up into their drama for over a month. Half of my class is out from the chicken pox. So… yea, I have more energy tonight.


ELANOR shrugs with a smile and brings the dishes to the kitchen. She stacks them in the sink.


ELANOR (VO)
Chipper eh? Didn’t think I could be, with you chipping away my heart all these years.
She takes two wine glasses from the high shelf and opens up a bottle of red to pour. In one cup she adds a few drops from a red tincture.


ELANOR (VO)
And little by little we will at yours.
ELANOR swirls back in living room, Ken looks up from his phone in shock. She gives him a glass and motions to toast!
KEN
Wow! Maybe they should vaccinate the kids more often.
ELANOR
Yes! To chicken pox!
KEN
To the pox!


INT. ELANOR & KEN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
In the adjacent bathroom shower is on. ELANOR walks up a nightstand to pick up Ken’s smartwatch, and flips to the heart rate history page. She takes a photo of it with her phone and texts DIANE.


ELANOR (MESSAGE)
I think, it worked.
ELANOR looks towards the bathroom door. Her own shadow is start against the wall. 


ELANOR (VO)
I wonder what you are like with her.


Daydream sequence.
Diane, Elanor and Ken in silhouettes dance across the bedroom wall. Elanor summons a Ken from the ground, they dance intimately. Ken pulls Elanor close, and their shadows combine. When they part it is Diane and Ken that separate, with Elanor in the middle. The two dance around Elanor. Diane comes towards Elanor as Ken moves into the background. Elanor reaches out to Diane. Diane pulls her into a dance. Ken fades backwards and disappears. Elanor and Diane dance an epic tango, but the music is interrupted by Vivaldi.


ELANOR comes back to reality to find Diane has texted her back.


DIANE (MESSAGE)
Great! Let’s forage this weekend.
EXT. WOODS - AT DUSK
ELANOR
Didn’t know park have poisonous flowers. My school has field trips here all the time.
DIANE
They aren’t poisonous, inherently. The nectar of the _ is only deadly combined with the pollen of _. The toxin takes about a week to build up to detrimental levels.
ELANOR
I’ve been waiting seven years, what’s another few days.
DIANE
May I ask? If you want out so badly, why not divorce?
ELANOR
A divorce would… My family can't afford another scandal, people church talk.
DIANE
You mean that other time when Ken…
ELANOR
No. He's smart enough to not dip his toes in that pool. (takes a deep breath) In middle school, I got pretty close with the pastor's daughter. We didn't know what to call it, but we were a little more than best friends.
DIANE
Gal pals?
ELANOR
One afternoon, her mom walked up to give us snacks. Then suddenly my family was going to another church.
DIANE
So your family is pretty religious, huh.


ELANOR
Not really. It wasn't that. They never asked if I am... if I like... Mom just said "that girl is a bad influence. Next Sunday we're checking out St. Robert Bellarmine". We weren't even Catholic. 
DIANE
Maybe they didn't want to admit it to themselves…
ELANOR
Church is the only community we had since coming to the States. Our old pastor helped my dad find his first job. I can't afford for my family to be at the center of gossip again. Not after we've finally found our place.
DIANE
You know, if we go through with this you might need to disappear for a while.
ELANOR
Yea. Maybe I’ll tell my parents Ken and I are going somewhere tropical.
DIANE
And you lost him to the waves?
Their plan didn’t go as planned, and Elanor ends up stabbing him.


EXT. THE WOODS - ALMOST DAWN
DIANE and ELANOR step back to look at the sapling tree they repotted. The sky is lightening up, birds start to sing.


DIANE
Have you thought of where you’ll like to go away to?
ELANOR
As long as you’re there with me, it doesn’t matter.
ELANOR reach for DIANE’S hand, and DIANE takes it a gives it a squeeze.


DIANE
Always.
ELANOR leans her head on DIANE’s shoulder. We pan to the sky that is lightening up, and we fade to white.
