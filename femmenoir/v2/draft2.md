# Int. Kai interviews Elanor

*In a room with no windows sits an KAI and ELANOR. There's a half empty box of tissues and by it a trash can filled with them.*

ELLA crying across front table

KAI

So last Thursday was the last time you saw Kenji Ishida?

ELLA

Yes. After our fight, he stormed out. 

`Elanor sniffles`

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

ELLA looks down and plays with the laces on her dress

KAI

Did he say where he was going?

ELLA

No. When he's angry, he just shuts down. He becomes a statue, it's impossible to get through to him, when he won't even look at you.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

KAI

Do you guys fight often?

ELLA

Never! `assertively`

ELLA (cont.)

Not until recently

KAI

What have you been fighting about?

ELLA

I mean it’s nothing. We are just trying to figured ourselves out. We got married so young. I think we both sometimes wonder what our lives would be like if we hadn’t.

KAI

Do you sometimes wish you aren’t in each others lives.

ELLA

No, it’s not like that! We are trying to work things out.

Ella starts to tearing up again, and through sobs say

ELLA

But it feels no matter how hard I try to fix us, his heart has sailed.

Ella leans into Kai’s shoulders. Kai awkwardly pats her shoulders.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

KAI

I’m sure once we find him, you guys can work it out.

ELLA

He’s gone! How do I do that?!

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

KAI

Do you know where he could have gone? Family or friends the could have stayed with?

ELLA

Well considering it was his sister who hired you, his family hasn’t seem him either. And he doesn’t really have friends, he’s lost touch with most of them since graduation.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

KAI

It’s hard to believe he doesn’t have any friends.

ELLA

Most guys don’t these days.

KAI

What about Diane Sun from his office?

---

ELLA looks up in shock

`Diane sits cross legged with one of her legs swinging. She is fully dressed in black. On the table is a hat with a mesh vail.`

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

*`Kai enters the room with a brown bag`*

KAI

Sure you're not hungry? 

`KAI takes a panini sandwich out of the bag.`

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

*DIANE wrinkles her nose and eyes the sandwich*

DIANE

No, I'm fine.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

KAI *raises half of the sandwich as if to toast.*

KAI

Next time, you're in the neighborhood. You gotta try Press, best panini shop in Queens.

DIANE

I don't frequent this area often, but thank you. I'm sure you didn't have me come this far out for lunch.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

KAI

Right, can you tell me when was the last time you saw Ken Ishida?

DIANE

Ken?! I… I haven’t seen him a while. Maybe a few weeks ago?

We share workspace, but we aren’t in same company.

# Int. Co-working space pantry

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Diane walks into the pantry

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Ken doing push-up on the floor

DIANE (VO)

I remember he used to do push-ups in the kitchen

`Diane’s eyes softens as she recalls how they met`

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

`DIANE‘S heel sinks into Ken’s hands`

DIANE (VO)

We saw each other around for months, but we didn’t talk until that morning. He was nervous about an investor meeting, so he was trying to calm himself down with push ups.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

`she loses balance and falls while Ken yelps in pain`

DIANE (VO)

It was like a clumsy meet-cute, straight out of a rom-com.

KAI (VO)

Rom-coms, eh? What’s your favorite?

DIANE (VO)

What does that have to do with anything?!

---

# Interview room

Diane & Ken sitting in the atrium

After a pause

KAI

Did you know he was married?

DIANE

Not until one day, I got up early to make us both lunch. But it turns out that his wife had sent him off with lunch that day too.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

KAI

Sound like you fallen hard by then.

DIANE

I should have known. Good things don’t happen. At least not to me.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Diane leaving Ken a bar

DIANE (VO)

I was going to let go, like I had so many times.

If there’s something Diane Sun is good at it’s getting over someone, had to to it so many times. I got a whole routine worked out and everything.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Ken pulls Diane back by her wrist and kisses her.

DIANE (VO)

But then he started telling me about his marriage. How he still felt alone, even with someone to lie next to every night.

He thinks she’s planning to leave him.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

montage of Diane and Ken’s moments

DIANE (VO)

And I started to wonder, what if he’s the one?

The situation is far from perfect, but maybe that’s it.

I had been long waiting for that picture book romance.

But life is cruel, and it tests you. Maybe I just need to be patient.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

KAI

These situations never end well for anyone involved, you know that right?

DIANE

`sly smiles` yea, I guess you are right.

KAI

You said you haven’t seen him in a while. I guess that means you guys ended things?

DIANE

When I met Ella

KAI

`about start another question`

DIANE

`quickly continues` Elanor Moon, this wife.

---

# Int. Interview room Elanor

> How she came to know about the affair

ELANOR
We no longer talked like we used to in high school, when we first got to know each other. I guess after all these years we assumed we know all there’s to know about eachother.
> 

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

ELANOR

She was not the woman, I'd expected.

KAI

What had you expected?

ELANOR

I didn't expect the other woman to be someone rather awkward; she looked so normal.

KAI

People always expects the mistress to be a beautiful seductress, but most of the time she's just a woman desperate to be loved.

ELANOR

`sighs and softens her eyes,` yea, Diane... is the type to open her heart to just about anyone. `lost in a daze`

# Flashback Elanor & Diane

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

ELANOR

Why do I smell my husband’s aftershave on you?

DIANE (VO)

There she stood, the reality of what I thought was my love story. All this time his wife felt like an abstract concept, but there she was right in front of me. If she were to physically hurt me, right then and there. I would have let her.

KAI (VO)

Did she?

DIANE (VO)

No, she….

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Elanor starts crying

ELANOR (VO)

I don’t know what came over me. I ran over in my mind so many times, all the things I’ll say to *this other woman*.

But right then and there, the reality of all I’ve feared. It felt so much worst than I had imagined.

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Ken in the office typing away

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Diane and Elanor out in a park, with the picnic Diane had prepared for her date

ELANOR

I had known for a while, but today I wanted to make sure.

DIANE

Why until now?

ELANOR

It was more of a feeling, we no longer talk anymore. Though I’m we’ve stopped talking long before you came onto the scene.

DIANE

Maybe sometimes it’s easier to talk to strangers. That’s how we started out strangers just talking. I never meant to…

ELANOR

It doesn’t matter.

DIANE

You know he still loves you a lot.

ELANOR

I know, but I still feel secondary to a person I’ve never met.

DIANE

I do too. I mean, I am aren’t I? You’re the wife. I think this only happened because Ken thought you were leaving him.

ELANOR

What?!

DIANE

Oh `realizes Ken lied to her about the state of his marriage`

---

# Int. Interview room w/ Elanor

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

KAI

So Diane confirmed your suspicious...

ELANOR

When Ken got home that night, I told him I know everything

KAI

Did he try to deny it?

ELANOR

No. He got on his knees and begged me to forgive him.

KAI

Forgiveness is yours to give, not for him to ask for.

ELANOR

There was a part of me that wanted to use this as an excuse to get a divorce. But he's the only love I've never known, so maybe it's worth a fight. He even agree to see counseling together.

KAI

Uh no, not the one next door? She's a quack, just skip the formalities and go see the one in the basement if you really want to fix your marriage.

ELANOR

If only you told me sooner. 

ELANOR (cont)

We really tried to work things out. I told him to never see Diane again.

# Int. Diane’s apartment

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Diane watching her phone

DIANE (VO)

That night Ken called me four times. The first three times, I let it go to voicemail. I knew what was coming.

KAI (VO)

Why did you finally answer.

DIANE (VO)

I guess I wanted closure. Even if I knew why, I still needed to hear the words from him.

Diane *holds the veil on her hat over her eyes*

DIANE (VO)

He said he wanted to give me back my things.

---

# Int. Elanor & Ken’s house

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Elanor looks over a Pucca & Garu bag

ELANOR

So that’s everything?

Ken nods and walks away from the room.

Elanor pulls a silk scarf out of the bag slowly

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Elanor puts the scarf on herself, and twirls around in front of the mirror.

ELANOR (VO)

 I couldn't help to wonder what Ken saw in Diane.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Shadow Elanor summons a Shadow Ken from the ground, they dance intimately. 

ELANOR (VO)

What he did with her.

Elanor close her eyes.

The shadows are silhouettes  of the the characters against a the backdrop of Elanor’s bedroom.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Shadow Ken pulls Shadow Elanor close, their shadows combine. 

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

When they part it is Shadow Diane and Shadow Ken that separate, with Shadow Elanor is in the middle.

ELANOR (VO)

How he’ll touch her

Elanor’s runs her hands down her body

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Shadow Diane and Shadow Ken dance around Shadow Elanor.

ELANOR (VO)

 I let my mind play games with me. Always imagining the worst!

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Shadow Diane comes forward as Shadow Ken moves towards the background.

ELANOR (VO)

The way she sounds

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Shadow Elanor reaches out to Shadow Diane. Shadow Diane pulls her into a dance.

Shadow Ken fades backwards and disappears.

ELANOR (VO)

What her skin feels like

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Shadow Elanor and Shadow Diane dance an epic tango.

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

It ends with a kiss.

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Zoom into Elanor opening her eyes in shock.

# Int. Interview Diane

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

DIANE

A few days later, Elanor who came to drop off my things. I almost wanted ask her to leave it at the door. I couldn't bare for anyone to see me that day.

KAI

Why not?

DIANE

Since Ken's call I haven't left my house. But I didn't want to treat her like a deliveryman during the pandemic.

---

# Int. Interview Elanor

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

ELANOR

When I waited at Diane's door my heart was pounding. It was a weird mix of excitement, nervous, and strange sadness. This will be the last time I will see her, only having just met her. I feel I might be missing out on the chance of something... I don't know.

KAI

You two did have a deep conversation last time you talked.

---

# Flashback Diane’s apartment entrance

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

ELANOR (VO)

Yes. When she opened the door, I saw someone I didn't want to recognize. My mother had depression when we were growing up. She'll do her duties as a wife and mother, then after that sleep all day.

KAI (VO)

And you saw it in Diane.

ELANOR (VO)

Yes, but this was more acute. She looks like she hasn't showered in days. When I came into her apartment, I saw one of Ken's sweaters. I bet she's been living in it, and only took it off when she saw it was me at the door.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

ELANOR

Ken wanted to come see you to give these things back. But I felt it will be easier for us all, if I came instead.

Diane nods

ELANOR

It heavy, can I put it down somewhere?

Diane motions a spot on the pantry. Elanor steps in and looks around her apartment.

DIANE (VO)

I saw the way she looked at me and my apartment. I didn't want her to pity me.

---

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Diane couch has a big weighted blanket, Ken's sweater, plushies, and pillows. It looks as if she migrated the contents of her bed into the couch. There is a start contrast between the sparking clean kitchen with a vitamix, bowl of fruits. Line up as almost ritualistically are empty liquor and wine bottles. It was a space that was normally clean and minimalist, that acquired a new found clutter.

Elanor picks up an empty wine bottle.

ELANOR

I love this too. Have you tried their orange wine?

DIANE

No, I haven't. I only drink reds.

ELANOR

Even in the summer? You know, it's okay to like sweet things one in a while.

Diane gives a sheepish smile

ELANOR

I know, I'm not your favorite person right now.

Diane *starts picking up the clutter around the room, not looking at Elanor* 

DIANE

I don't blame you. It was bond to happen.

Diane throws the bottles in the recycle bin

DIANE

I’m silly to think our relationship could have turned out any differently.

ELANOR

Maybe go for someone who's single next time?

DIANE

Don't think my heart has capacity for a next time.

ELANOR

Give it time.

Diane *shakes her head* 

DIANE

It's not just this. It's all of it! I'm tired of trying to find the one.

ELANOR

Do you still believe that exist? The one?

DIANE

Even if it doesn't, I feel it's the delusion we must tell ourselves to keep going.

ELANOR

Even if it doesn't, we can still keep going. When we got married, I thought I had found the one.
But through the years of marriage, I've come to learn that it's less about destiny but choice.

DIANE

Like the act of me being on the apps in a choice? I am making an effort to find the one by seeking it rather than waiting?

ELANOR

Some what. How do you figure out if someone is the one?

DIANE

It's just a feeling. I haven't really had that feeling with anyone in a very long time.... well I've had with Ken, but...

ELANOR

Does the feeling tell you if you guys will be compatible or not?

DIANE

probably not.

ELANOR

Why don't you try my approach to dating for a while, and let me know how it turns out.

# Ext. deep in the woods ~ Nighttime

Sometime between 1-3am. It’s a full moon, but still dark. The only light sources visible are Elanor’s phone screen glare, and a few soft battery powered LED lamps of different animals. Elanor sits on a large rock, next her is a sapling fruit tree. Diane is busy digging a hole; there is a contrabass case nearby. They share a rare few moments of silence before Elanor starts almost nervously.

ELANOR

I can’t believe few months ago, my greatest fear was Ken leaving me.

DIANE

(rolls her eyes)
He was never going to do that!

ELANOR

(jumps of the rock and starts walking towards the hole)

What makes you so sure?

DIANE

 He’ll never go all in for me because he’s was always afraid I’ll leave him for a woman.

ELANOR

(appears right over the hole)
Because he doesn’t think he’ll be enough for you?

Diane stops digging, and turns to Elanor.

ELANOR
He used to say that to me too.

DIANE
But he’s the only partner you’ve ever had!

ELANOR
Technically, yes. Though in middle school, I got real close with the pastor’s daughter. We didn’t know what to call it, but we were a little more than best friends.

Diane pushes the shovel unto the ground with her foot and jumps up from the hole.

ELANOR
One afternoon, her mom walked came up to give us snacks. 

(Looks up at the moon)

Then suddenly my family was going to another church.

Diane looks at the moon too, a breezes passes through the leaves. Diane looks at the shovel, then to the hole. She turns to the cello case.

DIANE
I guess… guess…. Your family is pretty religious?

ELANOR
Not really. It wasn’t about *that*.

Mom just said “you and that girl are bad influence on each other. Next week we going to St. Mary’s”. But we weren’t even Catholic!

DIANE

Maybe they didn’t want to admit it to themselves.

ELANOR

That and the gossip. Our family cut lies with everyone from the old church, including our friends who helped dad get his first job. Church only “family” we had since coming to the States. 

Elanor has tears welling up in her eyes. 

Diane reaches out to offers a hug, but pulls back.

ELANOR

After that, I swore to not cause my family trouble again.

DIANE

Time to bury our troubles.
