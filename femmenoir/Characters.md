## Intro scene

### disappointing date

APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT

*Slow French jazz plays, in a dimly lit elegant bathroom. DIANE woman in her 30s in a black dress. Camera shows bits of her body as she shaves her legs, puts on a dress, curls her hair, and applies make up. Her movements are lingering and slow, in time with the song. We don't see her face until the camera pans up her body from behind (60 degrees from center), we she her reflection in her mirror. She is applying eyeliner and draws the second eye unevenly.*

DIANE
Fuck

*The music stops. DIANE dab her face with make up remover rapidly and splash water on her face. A new background song starts, it's a fast pace lively funky song starts with a trumpet solo. She fixes the rest of her make up and dashes out her apartment door.*

*The ground is wet, as if it has just rained. There are puddles everywhere.*

DIANE *sprints several blocks to a LIRR station in Queens. She makes the train just in time as it departs. *

FIDI ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT

DIANE *looks around near the shoe rental. Then she looks to her phone.*

DIANE
blue coat

DIANE *looks again and searches with a more purposeful glare.*

GUY1 *tall, medium built, in blue jacket. He waves and walks towards DIANE.*
Wow, you're....

DIANE *Feels around her hair to see if it messed up on the way.*

GUY1
Way prettier than your pictures

DIANE *blushes*

GUY1 *reach one hand out and the other one motions towards the skating rink.*
Shall we?

DIANE *nods*

*View zooms out to the rest of the skating rink and holiday lights.*

FIDI RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT

*DIANE and GUY1 are walking along the waterfront. DIANE has both of her fingers entwined she is looking down. GUY1 has both of his hands in his jacket pockets and is looking around at the other pedestrians. She stops walking and looks up to smile.*

DIANE
I had a really nice time

GUY1
Ah... me too.

GUY1 *pauses, taking his hands out of his jacket pockets and raises one to scratch his head.*

GUY1
Umm.. but.. I don't think we should go on a second date.

DIANE
Oh

GUY1
It's not you ---

DIANE
No, it's ok. That's how these things go ---

GUY1
Sometimes. Yea...

DIANE
Right. Good night?

GUY1
Night.

GUY1 *puts his hands back in his pockets and turn to walk away.*

DIANE sighs and towards the river.

DIANE mutters
Again?

SUBWAY STATION MEZZANINE - NIGHT

*A trains has just arrived at the platform and DIANE swipes through the turnstyle, rushing to catch the train. But she slips on a puddle and falls on her butt. She sits dumb founded, unable to believe her luck. We hear the train's doors close and departs. Her coat, dress, and even underwear is soaked. Upon realizing this she makes a disgusted face. She shivers as she gets up, she tries her best to hold back from the stream of tears threatening to pour out. She makes her way down to an empty subway platform.*

*DIANE paces around the platform shivering. She looks at the tunnel as if checking to see if there's another train coming. There is no train, but she still hovers over the edge. We follow her gaze, as she looks past the signal lights into the darkness.*

voice of reason. Their arc is being consistently reminded that people in these situations are not reasonable. At the end they decide to rule Ken's death a suicide, even though they have enough evidence to get Diane and Elanor in for manslaughter.
